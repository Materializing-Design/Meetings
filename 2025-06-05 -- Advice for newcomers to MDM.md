## Notes 
(originally a google doc [find here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YjecssFp_9ERxxMwWniR_IFkwhPFXACkwWfz5SzndM/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0). 

Please add suggestions here based on your experience of using MDM.

You are welcome to comment on technical setup // your approach to MDM // how it ties in with RtD or research-creation // “design hygiene” // how it helps you most // how it has facilitated authoring of publications or dissertation writing // what you’ve used it for most successfully, etc.

* Write for yourself. It is your project and your process that you’re trying to capture. You can polish things up later, and make it seem more professional in your official documentation, but you won’t really know the through line until the end  
* Make make make. Make anything. Something good, something bad, something shitty, something that keeps breaking down. As long as you can point at it and say something about it, it will be more valuable than vague ideas and vibes   
* 5 commits about you having a breakdown are more useful than a lack of commits. You don’t want to include neither in your final report, but at least the former will be more useful when retracing your steps and reverse engineer why certain decisions were made  
* It’s more important for you to document than it is for you to “document well.” Don’t get bogged down in worrying about what you’re writing; just write.  
* Set yourself a goal to take a step back from the in-the-moment process at least once-a-week and reflect from a more high-level on what you’ve done recently.   
* Screenshots, sketches, sound clips, gifs, playable builds: these are all gold  
* Do write “the (a?) thing at the end”  
* Organize emails (sort them in folders) and maintain meeting minutes to track reflective thoughts.   
* Keep a note to save the fleeting thoughts that slip through to free up some brain space.  
* Do create and revisit and add to a “Why?” document  
* Dress Rehearsal: You’ll learn how this process will benefit you only by doing it \- try various modes of capture (notes, audio notes, photos)  
* Forming a mental model of where the materials that feature in journal entries would come from (wireframes, prototype tests, etc.)  
* Personal feelings are fine to report\!  
* Something about not having to apply all the components of the method at once, maybe just “start with the commits” or something
