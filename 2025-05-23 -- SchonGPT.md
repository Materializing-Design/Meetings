**Rilla**: Asked about Design intentions of SchonGPT

**Vadim**: 
- A design reflection partner who doesnt have any needs, doesnt need sleep. 
- You have someone to bounce around ideas. Someone who is not too judgy or gives too many compliments. 
- Rooted in D. Schon's design conversation practice. The prompt is fed with some of his literature. 
- We're looking to see it works 
- Gave it instructions about tone, questions to ask, lit to reference but not to overtly reference it but to use it as underlying inspiration for the questions.

**Matt**:

- Difficulties getting into SchoenGPT first because expectation was to interact with it like with ChatGPT
- It was generally pretty good in responding to design descriptions
- Helpful in discussing audio interactions
- Brought up angles not thought of before

**Poki**
- It helped to think out loud very well
- Helpful in discussing development of game mechanics related to triggering empathy in players
- Asked question that led to consider things not though of before
- It doesn't provide answers but keeps on guiding to think through the design questions

Rilla notes that conversations stopped not at a natural ending point but led to bigger open questions.

**Courtney**
- Discussed a question based on future design trajectories of her project
- Explored a specific mechanic related to dealing with the topic of self-esteem in her game
- Found the conversation very useful
- Used the conversation partner as a space to externalize her thoughts
- It was trying to bring her back to her intention via its questions
- The reflective design interview led to a revelation about the game mechanic in question
- Stopped the conversation to reflect on it and return to it at a later time
- Recognized the intended facilitation of reflection on action (and in action)


Rilla: Depending on the design context, users may have different intentions in using SchoenGPT and aspects/parts of their process they're looking at.

**Shahrom** (after removing compliments from the prompt)
- SchoenGPT did not respond to questions but kept asking them, regardless of the user input
- 


"Do not make judgments" in the master prompt may have been too much toning down the compliments at the start of the GPT's reflective feedback. The GPT became less gentle and started responding less like a therapist.


**Femke** (also after removing compliments from prompt)
- Was missing bullet points, or some other form of clear formatting in its responses
- Too question-oriented
- Suggests for the GPT to motivate the user to eventually provide their own answer to mark an ending point of the conversation
- Compared SchoenGPT to regular ChatGPT

Rilla: Adding modes of use for users who prefer to have some suggestions.
Generate at the end of the conversation an overview of questions covered, directions to pursue, and suggestions of approaches to try next.


**Pippin**
- Had an interesting experience that felt like a meta experience, curious about seeing its general approach in addressing design thinking
- Feels like it is not a real person
- Felt like SchoenGPT doesn't know what he was talking about
- Being provoked negatively (disagreeing with the GPTs questions) is not necessarily a bad thing
- Was pushing back on some of the GPTs responses - but saw that as a good thing
- Felt uncomfortable talking to ChatGPT in general
- GPT lost the plot a little bit

**Rilla**
- Managed to pick up on the core of her design intentions
- Oblique strategies vs. SchoenGPT "more hair vs. less hair"
